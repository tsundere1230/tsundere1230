# Hi, I'm tsundere

I'm a mathematics educator who likes coding in her free time.

<p>
  Recently I've been working on <a href="https://escapehkbeta.surge.sh/arianna/welcome.html">EscapeHK</a>, an online escape room puzzle currently in semi-public alpha. The format is heavily inspired by <a href="https://ebonyriddle.com/">Ebony.</a>
  Features:
  - 30 numbered levels with branching exits (about 50 levels in total)
  - Original sound track also composed by me
  - Original characters and story
  
  Feel free to report bugs by messaging me!

  I've also been working with the <a href="https://stardb.gg/">StarDB</a> team for their weekly puzzle challenge.
  They are a bunch of great coders that provide an invaluable system for "Honkai: Star Rail" players who want to mald a bit ðŸ«£

<p>
  I'm also looking to make my website where I can also put my music things, but no concrete plans for that yet ðŸ˜­
