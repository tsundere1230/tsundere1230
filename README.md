# Hi, I'm Tsundere (you can call me tsun)

I'm a cosplayer and musician who likes coding in her free time.


Recently I've been working on [EscapeHK](https://escapehkbeta.surge.sh/arianna/welcome.html), an online escape room puzzle currently in semi-public alpha. The format is heavily inspired by <a href="https://ebonyriddle.com/">Ebony.</a>
Features:
- 30 numbered levels with branching exits (about 50 levels in total)
- Original sound track also composed by me
- Original characters and story
  
Feel free to report bugs by messaging me!

I've also been working with the [StarDB](https://stardb.gg/) team for their weekly puzzle challenge.
They are a bunch of great coders that provide an invaluable system for "Honkai: Star Rail" players who want to mald a bit ðŸ«£

I'm also looking to make my website where I can also put my music things, but no concrete plans for that yet ðŸ˜­
